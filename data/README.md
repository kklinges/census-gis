The unhelpfully named `list1.xls` is the July 2015 Core based statistical areas (CBSAs), metropolitan divisions, and combined statistical areas (CSAs) Delineation File exactly as downloaded from the US Census Bureau website: [https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/demo/metro-micro/delineation-files.html](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/demo/metro-micro/delineation-files.html). `list1.csv` is the same data with header and footer rows stripped out and converted to text for import into statistical software or databases.
