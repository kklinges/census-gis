====
Lab created by Cody Spence ([tua86063@temple.edu](tua86063@temple.edu)) and Xi Wei ([tud52132@temple.edu](tud52132@temple.edu))

Overview
--------------------
-	Create a series of choropleth maps using the **Time Manager** plugin in QGIS
-	Use **Photoshop** to create an animation of change in racial composition over time

Data Preparation 
--------------------
-	Download the [**Race_1940_1990** shapefile](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2vdex4gau76omb/Animation_Lab_data.zip?dl=0)
-	Install **Time Manager plugin** in QGIS

Create a Choropleth Map and add to Time Manager
-------------------------------------------------------------
Now, you are going to create a choropleth map showing the percentage of the population of each census tract that is either White or non-White (you choose which one).

-	Layer Properties--> Style
-	Click "Graduated" symbol

Notice that neither the **"Percent_Wh"** nor **"Percent_NW”** columns are available for selection. Both columns are in string format.  Use the expression dialog to convert either column to a **numeric** format.   Click OK.

![EXPRESSION DIALOG](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-diC3do2wsKo/WCE4LPxFFRI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/IolRdez_2rMa__WbfHfmx9QXNOjuE2vTwCLcB/s0/picture1.png "picture1.png")\ 
 
 

Choose the **“Natural Breaks”** classification and click OK.


Next, we will add the layer to Time Manager.  

-	Click **“Settings”** on the Time Manager toolbar.
-	Click **“Add layer”**
-	In the dialog box that appears, change the Start Time to **“New_Start”**.  This indicates to time manager which column in the attribute data worksheet lists the date.  Click OK.

In the Time Manager toolbar, change minutes to **“years”** and change the time frame size to **10** (so each "frame" is a map of a different decade). 
 Your animation is now ready to export to PhotoShop!  First, however, we must create a legend.  
 
-	Create a new print composer
-	Add a legend to the composer (you don’t even need to add the map)
-	Label the legend appropriately 
-	Use the “Snipping Tool” to cut and save an image of your legend (search snipping tool in Windows)

Export Choropleth Maps from QGIS
----------------------------------------------------
Before exporting your maps, make sure you: 

-	Click on **"Export Video"** in Time Manager Box, it provides you two options of outputting. One is **"Frames only"**, which outputs each frame into an image. The other is ‘Animated gif’, which requires you to have ImageMagick in path, Linux only. 
-	Choose **"Frames only"** (because we aren't using Linux). Create a new folder to store images. Click OK.
-	Open up the folder and make sure you have six images. 

![Export](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UJ3QU8wZZL0/WCFAM2fWU9I/AAAAAAAAAE4/e9kyJi68C8syNqRWb5JYlN85UEyyqUYwgCLcB/s0/picture3.png "picture3.png")\ 


Create Animation using Photoshop
---------------------------------------------------
-	Open **Adobe Photoshop**

>**Note**
>If you are using lab computer, PS is located in the **Adobe** folder in **START** menu.

-	Import the images to Photoshop. 


>**Note**
>To import multiple images into one workspace, drag one image to canvas first, select the rest and drag them to canvas, and then keep hitting **‘Enter’** until they are all imported.

-	Open **"Window"** > **"Timeline"**
-	A workspace will pop up on the bottom, choose 
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OwH2vRubY3VJMOZSKF1ncZz8W_7-o1AE19_M8-9WcOdOg3eSmqMrPx76Z7Q2tJ8QkZaT_9U=s0 "Frame_animation.JPG")\ 

-	Then click on ![\[picture\]](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MbyaEe-GZqE/WCHvT87biKI/AAAAAAAAAFw/dpPGQZgfH1Qmh0kGKsho-ByrRHYf4hIdQCLcB/s0/corner_pic.JPG "corner_pic.JPG") on top right corner of the box, choose **"Make frame from layers”**. Now all frame should be added to timeline. 
>**Note** 
>Make sure you have the right order of frames in your timeline.

-	Set all frame delays to 1s except the last frame, which you will set to 2s.
-	Choose **”Forever”** to create a loop for your animation.
-	To export as animation, go to **”File”** > **”Save for web”**
-	Make sure you choose **”Forever”** from “Looping options”

Assignment
---------------------------------------------------
-	Add **Title**, **Legend**, and **Credit** to your map
-	Make a GIF for both **White** and **Non-White** population change.
